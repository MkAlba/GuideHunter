A Quarter Life Crisis (QLC) can sneak up on you anytime between ages 24 - 35. You've done everything 'right' - studied, moved out, got a job, got a relationship - but you don't feel 'right'. You thought you were going to be successful, happy and fulfilled by this point. Instead you feel lost, stuck, insecure, disappointed about your career, and confused. You want to run away but don't know where. You want to change but don't know where to even start. Worst of all, you feel like you're the only one going through this.",
